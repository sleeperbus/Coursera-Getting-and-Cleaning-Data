## This repo is for Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project.
I want to write many things about this course project. But english is not my mother languate so it's difficult to express my thoughts. 
So... All explantion is on source file "run_analysis.R". I'm sorry about that. Please see the source file. 
I spent almost 8hours to complete this course preject. R is... powerful but too vague. I'm missing other lanuages. 
Have a good day and good luck.
